# pydis-scj-2021
Summer Code Jam 2021

Twice a year we host a code jam for members of our server to participate in. The code jam is an event where we place you in a team with 5 other random server members. You then have 7 days to code some sort of application or program in Python. Your program must use the specified technology/framework and incorporate the theme chosen by the server.

After the 7 days is complete, your team has 2 days to finish documentation and create a video presentation showcasing and walking through the program that your team has created. More details and specifics of this will be released within the next 2 weeks.

## Technology

The chosen technology/tech stack for this year is Text User Interfaces (TUIs). Each team must create a program with one of the approved frameworks that creates a user interface that is text based. For more information of TUIs and what's involved with such an interface, check out this wikipedia article.
The Qualifier

The qualifier is a coding challenge that you are required to complete before registering for the code jam. This is meant as a basic assessment of your skills to ensure you have enough python knowledge to effectively contribute in a team environment.


## How to Join

To enter into the code jam you must complete The Qualifier and submit the sign-up form. Don't forget to join us on Discord at [discord.gg/python](https://discord.gg/python)!
